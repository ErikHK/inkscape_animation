Both spsvgview and sodipodi are mostly built frome set of common
libraries (these are static of course, to save people from
versioning pain, but can in theory function as dynamic libs
as well).
The shared dynamic SVG GUI is built from:
* libarikkei, libnr, libnrtype - lowlevel helper code
* libspxml - xml backbone
* libspsvg - svg parsing helpers
* libspdisplay - GUI-independent renderer
* libsodipodi - dynamic SVG document
Sodipodi and spsvgview attach SVG document to different
widgets (SPDesktop and SPSVGView), plus sodipodi adds
extra controller parts (event contexts, selections, dialogs).
The separation is still not 100%, but quite close, and should
be easy to complete, if needed.
