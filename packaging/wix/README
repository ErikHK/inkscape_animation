howto create windows msi installer

you need:
1. WiX Toolset (aka Windows Installer XML)
   get it from http://wixtoolset.org/
   (3.10 works fine at the time of this writing)

build the installer
1. build inkscape
2. open command shell "cmd"
3. change current directory to inkscape\packaging\wix
4. set environment variables using
     wixenv.bat    (adjust paths in the file if necessary!)
5. create installer using
     install.bat

when completed there should be inkscape.msi in your path

helpful tips
- set  CompressionLevel="none"  in inkscape.wxs
  while experimenting with installer creation
  (results in huge installer but much faster compilation times)

things still todo
- detailed explanation what to do for new revisions
- better filenames (nightly builds versus releases)
- howto remove python .pyc files after deinstallation
- localisation into the installer
- make "Typical" and "Complete" installations actually install different files
  (at least don't lie to the user by suggesting there would be two different choices)
- conditionally install localized content according to the users previous feature choices
  (e.g. only install translated versions of tutorials if the "Tutorials" feature is selected)
