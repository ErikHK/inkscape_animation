This folder contains Inkscape extensions, i.e. the scripts that
implement some commands that you can use from within Inkscape. Most of
these commands are in the Extensions menu.

Each *.inx file describes an extension, listing its name, purpose,
prerequisites, location within the menu, etc. These files are read by
Inkscape on launch. Other files are the scripts themselves (Perl,
Python, and Ruby are supported, as well as shell scripts).

Only include extensions here which are GPL-compatible.  This includes
Apache-2, MPL 1.1, certain Creative Commons licenses, and more.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html for guidance.
