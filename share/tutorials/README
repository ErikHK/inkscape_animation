This folder contains the Inkscape tutorials in SVG format. You can access them
from within Inkscape via the Help > Tutorials submenu. 

DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES DIRECTLY. They are generated from DocBook sources that
are stored in the doc-docbook module in Inkscape SVN. If you want to edit, 
translate, or create a new tutorial, obtain that module and follow the 
instructions in its README to edit a tutorial and regenerate the SVG format for 
the tutorial you changed. Then place the new SVG file here.

This folder contains all tutorials in all languages for which translations were 
provided. Later we may separate tutorials into language-packs.
