This is the directory with the Inkscape color palettes. 
They are in Gimp format (.gpl). Within Inkscape, they
can be accessed by a drop-down menu in the Swatches
dialog (Ctrl+Shift+W).

Internationalization

This file is internationalized the same way as share/filters/filters/svg
The i18n.py script called from the makefile will extract strings from the *.svg
into a *.svg.h file. Intltool is then able to extracts these strings just like
from normal .h files.
