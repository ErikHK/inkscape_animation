/**
 * Draggable point, the workhorse of on-canvas editing.
 *
 * Control points (formerly known as knots) are graphical representations of some significant
 * point in the drawing. The drawing can be changed by dragging the point and the things that are
 * attached to it with the mouse. Example things that could be edited with draggable points
 * are gradient stops, the place where text is attached to a path, text kerns, nodes and handles
 * in a path, and many more.
 *
 * @par Control point event handlers
 * @par
 * The control point has several virtual methods which allow you to react to things that
 * happen to it. The most important ones are the grabbed, dragged, ungrabbed and moved functions.
 * When a drag happens, the order of calls is as follows:
 * - <tt>grabbed()</tt>
 * - <tt>dragged()</tt>
 * - <tt>dragged()</tt>
 * - <tt>dragged()</tt>
 * - ...
 * - <tt>dragged()</tt>
 * - <tt>ungrabbed()</tt>
 *
 * The control point can also respond to clicks and double clicks. On a double click,
 * clicked() is called, followed by doubleclicked(). When deriving from SelectableControlPoint,
 * you need to manually call the superclass version at the appropriate point in your handler.
 *
 * @par Which method to override?
 * @par
 * You might wonder which hook to use when you want to do things when the point is relocated.
 * Here are some tips:
 * - If the point is used to edit an object, override the move() method.
 * - If the point can usually be dragged wherever you like but can optionally be constrained
 *   to axes or the like, add a handler for <tt>signal_dragged</tt> that modifies its new
 *   position argument.
 * - If the point has additional canvas items tied to it (like handle lines), override
 *   the setPosition() method.
