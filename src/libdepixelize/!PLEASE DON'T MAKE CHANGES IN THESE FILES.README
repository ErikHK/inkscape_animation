All code files in this directory are *direct* copies of the files in
libdepixelize's BZR repo.
If you want to change the code, please change it in libdepixelize, then copy the
files here.
Otherwise, I will probably miss that you changed something in Inkscape's copy,
and destroy your changes by copying libdepixelize's files over it during the
next time I update Inkscape's copy of libdepixelize.
