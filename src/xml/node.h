/**
 * @brief Interface for refcounted XML nodes
 *
 * This class is an abstract base type for all nodes in an XML document - this includes
 * everything except attributes. An XML document is also a node itself. This is the main
 * class used for interfacing with Inkscape's documents. Everything that has to be stored
 * in the SVG has to go through this class at some point.
 *
 * Each node unconditionally has to belong to a document. There no "documentless" nodes,
 * and it's not possible to move nodes between documents - they have to be duplicated.
 * Each node can only refer to the nodes in the same document. Name of the node is immutable,
 * it cannot be changed after its creation. Same goes for the type of the node. To simplify
 * the use of this class, you can perform all operations on all nodes, but only some of them
 * make any sense. For example, only element nodes can have attributes, only element and
 * document nodes can have children, and all nodes except element and document nodes can
 * have content. Although you can set content for element nodes, it won't make any difference
 * in the XML output.
 *
 * To create new nodes, use the methods of the Inkscape::XML::Document class. You can obtain
 * the nodes' document using the document() method. To destroy a node, just unparent it
 * by calling sp_repr_unparent() or node->parent->removeChild() and release any references
 * to it. The garbage collector will reclaim the memory in the next pass. There are additional
 * convenience functions defined in @ref xml/repr.h
 *
 * In addition to regular DOM manipulations, you can register observer objects that will
 * receive notifications about changes made to the node. See the NodeObserver class.
 *
