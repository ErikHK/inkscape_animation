This directory contains code that handles the XML tree.

Classes to store the parsed XML of an SVG document. Fairly generic,
and doesn't contain significant SVG-specific functionality. The main
distinguishing features (from something like libxml++) are
notifications about XML changes and undo functionality. This subsystem
is garbage-collected. Because XML nodes were formerly C structures
called SPRepr, the XML tree is sometimes called the "repr tree", and
XML nodes "reprs" (short for "representation").
