/**
 * @brief Interface for XML node observers
 *
 * This class defines an interface for objects that can receive
 * XML node state change notifications. The observer has to be registered using
 * the Node::addObserver() method to be notified of changes of this node only,
 * or using Node::addSubtreeObserver() to also receive notifications about its
 * descendants. All observer methods are called when the operations in question have
 * been completed, just before returning from the modifying methods.
 *
 * Be careful when e.g. changing an attribute of @c node in notifyAttributeChanged().
 * The method will be called again due to the XML modification performed in it. If you
 * don't take special precautions to ignore the second call, it will result in infinite
 * recursion.
 *
 * The virtual methods of this class do nothing by default, so you don't need to provide
 * stubs for things you don't use. A good idea is to make the observer register itself
 * on construction and unregister itself on destruction. This will ensure there are
 * no dangling references.
