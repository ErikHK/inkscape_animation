//! @brief  The JunctionRef class represents a fixed or free-floating point that 
//!         connectors can be attached to.  
//!
//! A JunctionRef represents a junction between multiple connectors, or could
//! be used to specify an intermediate point that a single connector must route
//! through.
//!
class AVOID_EXPORT JunctionRef : public Obstacle
{
    public:
        //! @brief  Junction reference constructor.
        //!
        //! Creates a junction object reference, and adds it to the router
        //! scene.  This junction will be considered to be an obstacle.
        //! This will cause connectors intersecting the newly added junction
        //! to be marked as needing to be rerouted.
        //!
        //! If the router is using transactions, then changes will occur
        //! the next time Router::processTransaction() is called.  See
        //! Router::setTransactionUse() for more information.
        //!
        //! The junction can be moved with Router::moveJunction() and removed
        //! from the scene and freed with Router::deleteJunction().
        //!
        //! libavoid expects junctions to have sensible positions (i.e.,
        //! for junctions to be positioned outside of shapes).  When routing 
        //! it will simplify hyperedges by moving junctions while preserving 
        //! hyperedge topology, i.e., not altering the sides of shapes the 
        //! hyperedge routes around.
        //!
        //! If you don't have sensible positions for junctions or want to 
        //! disregard the junction position and reroute the entire hyperedge 
        //! considering only the endpoints, then this can be achieved by 
        //! registering the hyperedge with the HyperedgeRerouter class
        //! obtained by calling the Router::hyperedgeRerouter() method.
        //! 
        //! When the improveHyperedgeRoutesMovingJunctions router option is
        //! set (the default) the junction position is a suggestion used for
        //! initial routing, but subsequent hyperedge path improvement may
        //! suggest new junction positions for the updated routings.  This
        //! position can be accessed via the recommendedPosition() method.
        //!
        //! When the improveHyperedgeRoutesMovingAddingAndDeletingJunctions
        //! router option is set (not the default) junctions and connectors
        //! can be added or removed to further improve hyperedges, see also
        //! Router::newAndDeletedObjectListsFromHyperedgeImprovement().
        //!
        //! @note Regarding IDs:
        //!       You can let libavoid manually handle IDs by not specifying
        //!       them.  Alternatively, you can specify all IDs yourself, but 
        //!       you must be careful to makes sure that each object in the 
        //!       scene (shape, connector, cluster, etc.) is given a unique, 
        //!       positive ID.  This uniqueness is checked if assertions are
        //!       enabled, but if not and there are clashes then strange 
        //!       things can happen.
        //!
        //! @param[in]  router   The router scene to place the junction into.
        //! @param[in]  position A Point representing the position of the 
        //!                      junction.
        //! @param[in]  id       Optionally, a positive integer ID unique
        //!                      among all objects.
        //!

// To prevent C++ objects from being destroyed in garbage collected languages
// when the libraries are called from SWIG, we hide the declarations of the
