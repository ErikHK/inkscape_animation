This directory contains path and shape related code. This code is
partially replaced by lib2geom. We still rely on this code for:

* Binary path operations.
* Path offsetting.
* Finding start and end positions for lines text inside a shape.

To do:

* Move needed functionality to lib2geom or independent functions.
* Delete directory.
