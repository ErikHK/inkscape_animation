REM Directory containing the precompiled Inkscape libraries. Usually c:\devlibs or c:\devlibs64
if "%DEVLIBS_PATH%"=="" set DEVLIBS_PATH=c:\devlibs64

REM Directory containing the MinGW instance used for compilation. Usually c:\mingw or c:\mingw64
REM Note: Make sure there are no whitespaces in the path. MinGW doesn't like that.. ;)
if "%MINGW_PATH%"=="" set MINGW_PATH=c:\mingw64

@echo Setting environment variables for MinGW build of Inkscape..

@echo  DEVLIBS_PATH: %DEVLIBS_PATH%
@echo  MINGW_PATH:   %MINGW_PATH%

REM Include the MinGW environment in the path to prevent error messages during CMake configure.
set PATH=%DEVLIBS_PATH%\bin;%DEVLIBS_PATH%\python;%MINGW_PATH%\bin;%PATH%

REM Also set the pkgconfig path to prevent error messages during CMake configure.
set PKG_CONFIG_PATH=%DEVLIBS_PATH%\lib\pkgconfig
